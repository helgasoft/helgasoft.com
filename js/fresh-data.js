"158|Los Vaqueros Reservoir|The lake covers 1,500 acres, and the surrounding watershed lands span 18,500 acres. With the adjoining wild lands, there are roughly 225 square miles of contiguous greenbelt.The watershed consists of 19,300 acres of protected lands surrounding the Los Vaqueros Reservoir, which holds 100,000-acre-feet of stored drinking water.   The Los Vaqueros Project was approved and funded (100%) by Water District rate-payers in 1988 and the Project was completed in 1997 and  enables the Water District to pump high quality water from Old River in the Delta during wet months when salinity is low, then store it for use in the fall, when the Delta water quality is poor. The water is pumped from the Old River intake, then transported through several miles of pipeline to the reservoir, where it is stored.    Florida Strain Largemouth Bass are available throughout the lake, but few have targeted them since the opener. Try tossing plastic worms, crankbaits and jigs around rocky points and in the creek channels.  Channel, White and Bullhead Catfish are also available.   The watershed offers fishing, a boat rental marina, courtesy fishing docks, hiking and multi-use trails, picnic facilities, restrooms and three staging areas. Currently, there are 55 miles of trails with 12.5 miles designated for multi-use activity.  Los Vaqueros is a protected watershed environment that provides people with drinking water and numerous protected animal and plant species with a place to live. Because the reservoir stores drinking water, body contact sports (such as swimming) and personal watercraft are not allowed.  Dogs are not allowed at Los Vaqueros Reservoir.  Smoking is allowed only in designated smoking areas.  Possession and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages is not allowed at Los Vaqueros Reservoir.  Los Vaqueros is set in a foothill valley between Livermore and Brentwood, bordered by Morgan Territory and Round Valley regional preserves.|472||Contra Costa||1|1|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|-121.737875|37.819878|||LakesStocked|2019|158\r\n" +

"164|Echo Lake, Upper and Lower|Catchable rainbow trout are planted in the summer.  Echo Lakes are a glacially formed pair of lakes 10 miles south of Lake Tahoe in the Sierra Nevada mountains.  The area offers a variety of outdoor activities including boating, hiking, fishing, and camping in Desolation Wilderness.  Lower and Upper Echo lakes provide shore and boat fishing for catchable rainbow trout and brook trout.  Echo Chalet is a high-Sierra, summer-only, resort located near Echo Lake and is operated under permit of the United States Forest Service-Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit.  The Launch Ramp at Echo is available for public use during high water conditions for a fee.  Because of the threat of nuisance plants and mussels entering Echo Lake, marina operators we are required to inspect all vessels and control access to the lake.|7414||El Dorado||1|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|-120.062204|38.840326|||LakesStocked|2019|164\r\n" +

Today, Browns are abundant to 14 in., some to 5 lb with a few Rainbows to 2 lb. and occasional Lahontan Cutthroat. Check Sport Fishing Regulations. The river flows NE through an open canyon in a mostly undeveloped State Wildlife Area and becomes wadeable in Summer.  The nine roadside miles of the East Walker River near Bridgeport, on the East slope of the Sierra Nevada, is one of the best trophy Brown Trout streams in California.  In 1994, the Department purchased seven miles of riverfront property to preserve public access for fishing this productive tailwater. There is also a good chance of catching a Rainbow Trout or possibly a Mountain Whitefish.

"307|Hat Creek|Hat Creek is located in Shasta County in northern California.  It originates in Lassen Volcanic National Park and flows north to its terminus in Lake Britton. The Wild Trout Area consists of a three and one-half mile length beginning at the Hat #2 powerhouse and continuing to the rough fish barrier where the creek meets Lake Britton.  The Wild Trout Area of Hat Creek is unique among California waterways in that the streambed is partially composed of diatomaceous earth, and is similar in fishing quality to the chalk streams of southern England.  The streams in England have been known for centuries as `classic` examples of ideal trout streams.  Thus, this section of Hat Creek also enjoys the `classic trout stream` classification.  The creek is predominated by  Rainbow Trout with a smaller population of Brown Trout.  Due to the makeup of the stream, insect hatches in the area are large and consistent.  Many anglers from around the world come to fish Hat Creek for it's prolific hatches and beautiful scenery.  The challenging angling makes catching and releasing trout on Hat Creek all the more special!  Hat Creek holds a special place in the Wild Trout Program as a `flagship` water and as the site of one of the earliest experiments in special management for wild trout in California.|3,000|3 Miles|Shasta|Sierra|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|-121.56806|40.98762|||StreamsNotStocked||307\r\n" +

"510|Sacramento River (Shasta County) by Redding|The Sacramento River below Shasta Lake is a large river that typically flows several thousand feet per second.  Fishing opportunities exist year-round from Shasta Lake downstream over 160 miles to the confluence with the San Joaquin River near Sherman Island.  The river flows through a developed city area with some shoreline access.  Accessible by drift or power boats, bank, or wading.  High flows during Summer irrigation season create wading hazards.  Bait & tackle, store, propane, resort and telephone.  RV sites with hookups are readily available in the Redding city area.    Excellent resident Rainbow Trout population available year round.  Fishing success often depends on stream flows.  Runs of Steelhead and Chinook Salmon in the Fall and Winter months.  The river also contains runs of anadromous fish including Chinook Salmon, Steelhead (sea-run Rainbow Trout), Striped Bass, American Shad, Sturgeon, and resident Trout and warm water species where water temperatures and habitat is suitable.   Fall-run Chinook (King) Salmon generally enter the lower river in the late Summer and early Fall, reaching the upper river spawning areas and tributaries in October through November.  Spring-run Chinook Salmon enter the river in the Spring and are found in the river and some tributaries during the Summer and Fall.  Steelhead enter the lower river in the Fall and are generally found in the tributaries such as the American and Feather rivers, and Sacramento River above near Redding from late-November through March.  Anadromous striped bass begin their spawning migration in the Spring and are found throughout the river from May through June.  American Shad enter the river about the same time but the best fishing in the Sacramento River and tributaries is generally just before and after Memorial Day.  Anadromous fish are not able to ascend the river above Shasta Lake.  Resident Striped Bass, and Channel and White Catfish can be found in the river year round.  The river from Redding downstream to Anderson contains an excellent population of resident Rainbow Trout that provides fishing opportunities with both conventional and fly fishing tackle.  Because of the size of the river, shore access is often limited and boat access, especially in the lower reaches is preferred.  There are numerous guides that provide guided fishing trips year round throughout the river.|400-650|17 Miles|Shasta|Sierra|1|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|-122.34178|40.49516|||StreamsNotStocked||510\r\n" +

"644|Howard Lake|Howard Lake has unimproved camp sites with no water or toilets, primitive camping is also available away from the lake. For a safe and enjoyable camping experience, remember to obtain a fire permit and observe any seasonal fire restrictions.   No motors are permitted, small craft can easily be launched near the campsites.  The most abundant fish in this lake is the Golden Shiner and they often hug the shoreline, especially as juveniles. They are readily visible in schools around the lake on still days. This fish is not native to California and is a member of the Minnow family. It is not considered a game fish, yet it can grow up to about 10 inches and will take small flies on the surface. Fly fisherman should consider trying their luck on these fish when the trout bite has slowed, such as in mid day during the hotter days of summer.  Anglers can access more fish, but shore anglers can be successful as well. The Eastern side of Howard Lake would probably be most productive for bank fishing.  The lake also supports Western Pond Turtles. Sharp-eyed nature watchers can spot these small native turtles basking on lilypads or logs in the lakes. A pair of binoculars can give you a better view of these shy reptiles.|3,900|20 Acres|Mendocino|North Central|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|-122.989614|39.880136|||LakesStocked|2013|644\r\n" +

"785|Hammerhorn Lake|Located in the Mendocino National Forest, Hammerhorn Lake has a developed campground, with primitive camping also available away from the lake. For a safe and enjoyable camping experience, remember to obtain a fire permit and observe any seasonal fire restrictions.   No motors are permitted, small craft can easily be launched near the campsites.  The most abundant fish in this lake is the Golden Shiner and they often hug the shoreline, especially as juveniles. They are readily visible in schools around the lake on still days. This fish is not native to California and is a member of the Minnow family. It is not considered a game fish, yet it can grow up to about 10 inches and will take small flies on the surface. Fly fisherman should consider trying their luck on these fish when the trout bite has slowed, such as in mid day during the hotter days of summer.  Anglers can access more fish, but shore anglers can be successful as well. The Eastern side of Howard Lake would probably be most productive for bank fishing.  The lake also supports Western Pond Turtles. Sharp-eyed nature watchers can spot these small native turtles basking on lilypads or logs in the lake.  A pair of binoculars can give you a better view of these shy reptiles.|||Mendocino||0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|-122.990512|39.948481|||LakesStocked|2018|785\r\n" +

"960|Grass Valley Creek Reservoir|Grass Valley Creek Reservoir was created as part of ongoing efforts to restore the Trinity River watershed.  Its purpose is to prevent sediment in the highly erosive watershed from migrating downstream to spawning gravels in the Trinity River.  Grass Valley Creek Reservoir is located south of Highway 299 along the Trinity River in northern California.  In the process of trapping sediment, Rainbow Trout and/or juvenile Steelhead were isolated above the dam and a fine stillwater fishery for wild salmonids was created.  Access to the reservoir requires a short hike, and a float tube greatly inmproves fishing access much of the year. Many small inlets provide cool water refugia and concentrate fish.  Anglers should focus on these cooler areas for better success.|||Trinity|North Coast|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|-122.7575|40.625|||LakesNotStocked||960\r\n" +

"1770|Caspar Headlands SB|Caspar Headlands State Beach is located in Mendocino County approximately 4 miles north of the town of Mendocino.  This area has miles of undeveloped beach adjacent to the headlands and a panoramic ocean view.  Various marine fish species including Surf Perch, Rockfish, Jack Smelt, Pacific Mackerel, and Anchovy can be caught in the surf from the beach or around the near shore rocky areas.  The best tides for surf fishing are the high tide period and one to two hours before and after the high tide.  The best time is early morning and early evening and heavy surf makes fishing difficult.  Surf fishing anglers typically use longer surf rods from 10 to 12 feet long with spinning or casting reels capable of casting heavier weights beyond the breaking surf.  Fishing weights vary little and are usually a multi-ounce pyramid sinker clipped on a drop rig with the bait and leader further up the line.  Baits include live bait fish, blood worms, cut bait, and sand fleas.  Artificial lures such as spoons or plastic swim-type baits will work for schooling fish when they are feeding.  Rocky areas offer excellent opportunity for 'poke poling' an unique way to fish the holes and cavities in the rocks and sandy beach areas often provide claming opportunities. Check local tackle shops to see what is currenlty availalble and what anglers have been using; and review the California Ocean Sport Fishing Regulations booklet for seasons and bag limits.|0||||0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|-123.8264|39.3635|||OceansNotStocked||1770\r\n" +
